# Experiments Log

## Experiment 1: Baseline Model (2024-01-12)

### Configuration
- Model: Basic Transformer
- Dataset: 5% of Shakespeare text
- Epochs: 10
- Batch size: 32
- Embedding dimension: 512
- Number of heads: 8
- Vocabulary size: 11,914

### Results
- Test accuracy: 2.80%
- Test loss: 7.5568

### Analysis
Initial implementation shows the model is learning but with low accuracy. This serves as our baseline for future improvements.

### Next Steps
Potential areas for improvement:
1. Increase training data size
2. Experiment with different embedding dimensions
3. Try different attention mechanisms
4. Adjust learning rate and optimization parameters
5. Implement pre-trained embeddings
