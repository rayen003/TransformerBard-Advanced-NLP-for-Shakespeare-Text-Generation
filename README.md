# TransformerBard: Advanced NLP for Shakespeare Text Generation

A sophisticated implementation of a transformer-based language model for generating Shakespeare-style text. This project showcases advanced natural language processing techniques, attention mechanisms, and deep learning architectures.

## Overview
This repository implements and experiments with various transformer architectures for creative text generation. The project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Advanced NLP techniques
- Transformer architecture implementation
- Attention mechanism optimization
- Large language model training
- Systematic experimentation and analysis
